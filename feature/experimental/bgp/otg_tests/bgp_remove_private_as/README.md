# RT-1.11: BGP remove private ASÂ 

## Summary

BGP remove private AS

## Procedure

*   Establish BGP sessions as follows between OTG and DUT.
    *   OTG emulates two eBGP neighbors peering with the DUT using public AS numbers.
        *   DUT Port1 (AS 500) ---eBGP--- OTG Port1 (AS 100)
        *   DUT Port2 (AS 500) ---eBGP--- OTG Port2 (AS 200)
    *   Inject routes with AS_PATH modified to have private AS number 65501 from eBGP neighbor #1 
        (OTG Port1).
    *   Validate received routes on OTG Port2 should have AS Path "500 100 65501".
    *   Configure "remove private AS" with type PRIVATE_AS_REMOVE_ALL  on DUT.    
    *   Validate that private AS numbers are stripped before advertisement to the eBGP peer OTG 
        Port2.
    *   AS path for received routes on OTG Port2 should be "500 100".   
    *   TODO: different patterns of private AS should be tested.
        *   AS Path SEQ - 65501, 65507, 65554
        *   AS Path SEQ - 65501, 600
        *   AS Path SEQ - 800, 65501, 600
            ## TODO : https://github.com/openconfig/featureprofiles/issues/1659
            ## SET mode is not working in OTG. 
        *   AS Path SET - 800, 65505, 600
